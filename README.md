HTML Learning Experiments 🚀

Welcome to my HTML learning repository! This project is a collection of experiments and exercises assigned by my teacher to help me master the foundations of web development.
📌 Project Objective

The goal of this repository is to practice and document my progress in HTML5. I am focusing on building well-structured, semantic, and accessible web pages.
🛠️ Concepts Covered

During these experiments, I have worked on:

    Basic Tags: Headings, paragraphs, and text formatting.

    Lists: Ordered, unordered, and description lists.

    Media: Embedding images and creating hyperlinks.

    Tables: Organizing data using <table>, <tr>, and <td>.

    Forms: Creating user inputs, buttons, and labels.

    Semantic HTML: Using <header>, <footer>, <section>, and <article> for better SEO and accessibility.
